<p>There’s little the team wouldn’t do for the Nearspace program (including climbing a steep 250-foot hill in the rain!) and on Saturday, July 30, 2016, the team was put to the test.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Trekking up a 250 foot hill to recover the payloads.</p>

<p>NS-57 began a little earlier than the typical launch.  There were some predictions for rain later in the afternoon so as a result, the team left the SSL parking lot at 4:00 AM, skipping the traditional McDonalds breakfast visit.</p>

<p>Learning from NS-56, the team decided to do a Balloon Launch Tube (BLT) hybrid launch to measure the lift in the 3000g balloon before launching.  Unfortunately, after measuring the lift, the team had to make an executive decision to remove HABScope in order to ensure a successful flight.  The current hypothesis as to why we did not develop enough lift is that there might have been some leakage in the filling process.  After release, the balloon rose at a respectable 5 m/s.</p>

<p>Chase and Recovery</p>

<p>And… we have launch!  The balloon took off from Clear Springs, Maryland and headed north into Pennsylvania.  Rising to a final altitude of about 103’000 feet, the balloon popped around Greencastle, Pennslyvania, landing in Michaux State Forest.</p>

<p>Recovering the balloon brought a couple challenges of its own.  While the tracking team roughly pinpointed the balloon’s location, the team had to load up the radios to get a better location of the payload string.  About a mile later, the team was able to get radio contact with the payloads and homed in on their location using the trails to get as close as possible.</p>

<p>Retrieving the payloads required about a couple miles of bush-whacking through rain, lightning, steep terrain, and thick underbrush, but the team (and the payloads) all made it back safely if somewhat wet.  Based on a recommendation from Ranger Ted Ottinger, who was helping us, the team then enjoyed a well-deserved lunch at the Flamingo Restaurant right outside the state park.</p>
